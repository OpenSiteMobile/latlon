MobileSiteOS Latitude/Longitude Calc's Test Page
================================================

This repository contains the files used to test Chris Veness's (http://www.movable-type.co.uk) latitude/longitude calculation scripts, as loaded via MobileSiteOS. The page can be viewed at http://opensitemobile.com/latlon. And this page does use our MobileSiteOS software, but essentially only for module loading. As such, it is also demostrating a simple use case for MobileSiteOS were only the basic scripts are loaded. The original idea has always been to only use what you need, and add more as complexity requires.

Please see http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html for the original page, as rendered by the author's website, for additional information.
